# Wine Feature Visualization

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to visualize the features of the **Wine dataset** using histograms. The notebook loads the **Wine dataset**, explores its features, and provides insights into the distribution of various attributes using **matplotlib**.

## Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:
1. **Loading the Wine Dataset**: The **Wine dataset** is loaded from **Scikit-learn**.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The data is visualized to understand the distribution of different features using **histograms**.
3. **Feature Visualization**: The notebook plots histograms for various features of the wine dataset to gain insights into their distribution.

## Files in this Repository

- **`wine_feature_visualization.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook where the **Wine dataset** is loaded, and histograms are plotted for feature analysis.

## Features

- **Wine Dataset**: The dataset includes various attributes related to wine chemistry, such as alcohol content, color intensity, and proline levels.
- **Histograms for Feature Analysis**: Uses **matplotlib** to generate histograms that show the distribution of features in the dataset.
- **Data Exploration**: Provides a simple yet effective method to visualize data distributions and detect patterns or outliers.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
